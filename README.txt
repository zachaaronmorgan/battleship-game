Hello and welcome to my Battleship Terminal Game

The point of this project is to practice python, git and github, and other core concepts learned on Codecademy. I intend for this to be a fun little game for people to play if they're bored. This game is meant to be a two player game. As of right now both players need to be human in order to play.
